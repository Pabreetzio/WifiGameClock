This example is great for testing out the TM1637 module for the first time. 
You can head over to the github repository for the [Arduino library for TM1637](https://github.com/avishorp/TM1637) to get the required files.
Copy this repository into your arduino libraries folder. What worked for me was to put it at C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\TM1637
but your results may vary. I also restarted my Arduino IDE before attempting to use this example.

I picked out some pin mappings based on the NodeMCU v2 board I was using and shortened the delay so I could see tenths of a second.
