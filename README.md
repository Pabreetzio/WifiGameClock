#Wi-Fi Game Clock
The [Wi-Fi Game Clock](https://hackaday.io/project/16408-wi-fi-game-clock "Wi-Fi Game Clock project on Hackaday") is like a chess clock but with many more features. Since the clock connects to a wireless network you can connect many separate clocks to the same game. Setting up a particular time control is much easier through the use of an app on your smart phone rather than through the confusing interface of clock itself. The time spent on each move can be recorded for later study when reviewing the game. Tournament directors can set the time control and enforce penalties. Also, clocks for each player can be placed on opposite sides of the board. The possibilities for creating different handicaps are huge. There will be new types of time control that haven't even been invented yet for games like bughouse chess, in which there can be a limit to a team's time.
